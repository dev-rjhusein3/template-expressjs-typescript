# Template of ExpressJS server in TypeScript


Clone this repo with a depth of 1



Start up the server with  

```npm run devstart -- --port 43434```

The first set of double hyphens (`--`) takes the argument passed in the second half of the command (`--port 43434`) and forwards it to the `node {filepath}` command defined in the npm script `devstart`.  
It's the `npm` way to forward on a CLI argument.
